**Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Fashion-MNIST**
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic fashion images based on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator - that compete against each other to improve the quality of generated images.
**Key Features**
TensorFlow 2.x implementation
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for both generator and discriminator
Adam optimizer with custom learning rates for stability
Visualization of generated images during training
Detailed logging of loss and accuracy metrics
**Technical Details**
**Generator**
Input: Random noise vector (dimension: 150)
Architecture: Dense layer, followed by three Conv2DTranspose layers
Output: 28x28x1 grayscale image
**Discriminator**
Input: 28x28x1 grayscale image
Architecture: Two Conv2D layers, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and final Dense layer
Output: Binary classification (real or fake)
**Training Process**
Alternating training of discriminator and generator
Custom training loop for fine-grained control
Batch size: 64
Epochs: 30 (adjustable)
**Hyperparameters**
Noise dimension: 150
Generator learning rate: 0.00001
Discriminator learning rate: 0.00003
Adam optimizer beta1: 0.5

**Performance Metrics**
Generator loss and accuracy
Discriminator loss and accuracy
Visual inspection of generated images every 2 epochs

**Challenges Addressed**
Mode collapse prevention
Training stability through careful learning rate tuning
Balancing generator and discriminator performance

**Future Improvements**
Experiment with different architectures (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN)

**Generator: ** This part of the GAN creates new images starting from random noise. It tries to make these images look as real as possible.

**Discriminator: This part of the GAN evaluates images and tries to determine if they are real (from the training dataset) or fake (created by the generator).
